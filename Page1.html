<p> I love to play hockey and run track. I am a student at the University of Maine. However, before coming to school here I was enrolled at the University of Tampa.
At the University of Tampa I ran the 800m and the 400m dash for their outdoor track team at the division two level. However, I made the choice to come here so I could be closer to my family </p>

just a sophomore in highschool!
