<p> Karan: </p>
<p> My mother Karan will always be there to help me no matter what. While I was in Tampa I could have called her at any 
time with an emergency and she would have been on the next flight to Florida! She is very special to me, even though she
can be a pain in the butt sometimes. However, I know she only bugs me because she loves me! </p>
