<p> Peter: </p>
<p> My father Peter is a University of Maine alumni. However, he did not push me to hard to attend his former school.
One of the reasons I chose to come here was because of all the fun stories from his times here that his old frat brothers would tell me as a kid.
I decided that I wanted to create similar memories, which is why I am pledging his old frat. I have always looked up to my father
as someone who works hard. He works hard at his job in order to provide me with the opportunity to succeed in life so that I can
 one day do the same for my child. </p>
